## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The overall layout was simple and easy to put together, the only tricky part was the background pattern. As for the last couple of projects, I added some `IntervalObservers` as well. I really like how they can make a single page simple layout to be more interactive. That's why I tend to add some simple animations ever since I've learned about this technique. In brief, fun and cool project, I'd also like if it had a theme switcher from dark to light. I'd implement it by myself, but I still have two projects left to do.
